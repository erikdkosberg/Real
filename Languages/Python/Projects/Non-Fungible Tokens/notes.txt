The purpose of this directory is to quickly create and mint NFTs all from the command line.

This process starts with creating an image, in the file format of png

To create this file, we will be using the pygame library. This library allows us to quickly
create and place shapes on a window - and ultimately save that window as a png file.

shapes.py is an extension of the pygame api, allowing you to quickly customize new shapes.

mint.py will process a list of png files and mint them to opensea

ledger.py returns a dictionary of all NFTs and their relevant information
