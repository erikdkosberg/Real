Revolver is a cryptocurrency that fluctuates based on individual savings.

It is not a peer to peer transaction system, rather, a way to manage purchasing power locally.

The idea is that you make a purchase, and in real-time; your currency becomes less valuable.

This lets you know how valuable your savings are at any given point, as well as charted over time.

This statistic; however, is arbitrary in nature.

Thresholds serve the purpose of establishing a protected amount of currency which gets invested
     and profits returned into the base currency.

The base currency, also referred to as the local currency - is the real time value you see before
    making a purchase, signaling your purchasing power.

Part of the Threshold is reserved for the global currency;
    this is how you can send and receive revolver on an exchange.
