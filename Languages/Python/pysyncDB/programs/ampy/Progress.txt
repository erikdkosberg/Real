#CURRENT

Learning the software for 3D printing design. Tried out a couple of test files downloaded from
thingiverse. Was able to find 16x2 bezel display mounts that were already created and worked pretty solid; however, I think we might be able to make a more intricate design if we custom design it. There are a total of 4 different softwares that I am currently looking at bringing into the project(openSCAD, viewscad, tkinter, and jupyter). Jupyter should serve as the central repository and should be accessed via the command line at "Documents/Code/jupyter"

#ARCHIVE

Prototyping on breadboard with different modules. Confirmed functionality in the LCD and potentiometer. Ordered 3D printer and other necessary equipment to build out the design. Raspberry Pi powered by a switch with the Arduino powered by the Pi.
