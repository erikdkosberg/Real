This project seeks to provide a seamless interface between Python, JS, and HTML.

Python makes it easy to get your ideas out and test them, very quickly.

We need JaveScript to talk to the browser that will be hosting our website. 

We place the JS embedded inside of an <html> tag.

This solution is portable across many interfaces, as it depends on the localhost - which we use, even in production.
