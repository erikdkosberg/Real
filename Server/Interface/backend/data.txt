Local HTTP servers can be used to display HTML files in the browser. We can run these servers with built-in Python modules.

The server will be started on some port, which can be opened in a browser at:
	http://localhost:port

When this URL is entered, it looks for any files named ‘index.html’ placed in the same directory from which the server was started – to display in the browser window.

JavaScript can be placed directly inside of an HTML script tag to manipulate or call attributes and methods with in the (DOM) Document Object Model.

(AJAX) Asynchronous JavaScript and XML can be used to read files from a local web server. The more modern approach is to use the fetch API.

JS runs on the client’s browser, whereas if we wanted to add, update, or delete files we would need code living on the server. This is where a server-side language like PHP (we can also use Python) comes in to play.
