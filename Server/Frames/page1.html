		<p>Local HTTP servers can be used to display HTML files in the browser. We can run these servers with PHP on the localhost.</p>
        
        <p>The server will be started on some port, which can be opened in a browser at:
            http://localhost:port</p>

        <p>When this URL is entered, it looks for any files named ‘index.html’ placed in the same directory from which the server was started – to display in the browser window.</p>

        <p>JavaScript can be placed directly inside of an HTML script tag to manipulate or call attributes and methods with in the (DOM) Document Object Model.</p>

        <p>(AJAX) Asynchronous JavaScript and XML can be used to read files from a local web server. The more modern approach is to use the fetch API.</p>

        <p>JS runs on the client’s browser, whereas if we wanted to add, update, or delete files we would need code living on the server. This is where a server-side language like PHP (we can also use Python) comes in to play.</p>
